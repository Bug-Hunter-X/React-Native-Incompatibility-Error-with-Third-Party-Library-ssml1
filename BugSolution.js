To solve this problem, you can try the following solutions: 

1. Check the library's documentation to make sure that it is compatible with your version of React Native. Many libraries specify the versions of React Native they support. 
2. Try using an older version of the library. If the library is not compatible with the latest version of React Native, you may be able to use an older version that is compatible. To do this, specify a version range in your package.json file. For example:

```json
{"dependencies": {
  "my-library": "^1.0.0"
}}
```

3. Search for an alternative library. If you cannot find a compatible version of the library, you may need to find an alternative library that provides the same functionality. There are many React Native libraries available, so you should be able to find one that meets your needs.
4. Check the library's issue tracker or contact the library's maintainer. If you are still having problems, you can check the library's issue tracker to see if other users have reported similar problems. You can also contact the library's maintainer directly to ask for help.
